introduction: Since the nineties, bathrooms have been in many video games. Yet none get any credit.

Bathrooms in video games haven't actually been around for too long. The first example of a bathroom would probably be Duke Nukem 3d.

However these under-utilized rooms serve an important role in all games, often using all original assets.  Some only have bathrooms as filler where
users can find items.  Others go as far as including interactive components and gameplay relavence.

For example, in **No More Heroes**, the main character uses the bathroom as a save point. This does an excellent job of establishing the bathroom as
a daily routine that is part of the hero's life.  It is a safe place free from enemies.  Just like a good bathroom should be.

This site is devoted soley to those digital bathrooms we have grown accustomed to.  We will take you on a deep dive through histories interactive bathrooms, examining working and non working mirrors, and judging games soley off of those features.

I'm Matt Lewis, and along with my co-founders Tyler and Chelby, I hope you will join us on this excursion.
