Mario is a plumber by trade, yet most of his professional career has been completely unrelated to plumbing. It is known that he is quite
adept at traversing Koopa Kingdom's pipes, but rarely has a toilet been visible.

Luckily in Paper Mario Thousand Year Door, we are given a rare glimpse into Mario's ability to handle toilets.

As far as this publication is concerned, this is the only documented occurance of Mario using a toilet.

_Readers at home are encouraged to submit any other examples of Mario using a toilet._
