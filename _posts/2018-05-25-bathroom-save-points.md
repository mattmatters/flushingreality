Dead Rising is a task management series built on tight deadlines. It also has zombies in it.

The core gameplay loop is to traverse an area accomplishing tasks and escorting people from point to point.
Interestly, the game lacked any quick save or auto-saving functionality, meaning any run could be potentially deadly.

Luckily Capcom took a book out of games such as Resident Evil, by providing safe areas where a user can save.  The player had
to then make a choice as to whether is was worth spending some of their precious time seeking out a place to save, or press on.
In Dead Rising's case, this was either safe houses or _bathrooms_.

As a site devoted to polygonal bathrooms, we believe that Dead Rising has provided one of the most accurate representations of
bathroom experiences.  A bathroom should be a safe place where a person can decompress.  It also can put the rest of life on
hold for a brief moment. Dead Rising embodies that mentality, by providing a place with minimal zombies and interactive toilets
with a gameplay purpose.

We can only hope that Capcom will further expand on this mechanic in the inevitable sequel.
